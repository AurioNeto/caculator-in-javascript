# JAVASCRIPT CALCULATOR

This is a simple JS project with the sole objective of learning through pratical examples.

Here you will find two scripts files: script.js and script2.js. The first one is my own code without any tutorial or external direct help. The later is a code that I got from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw) and made some alterations as such:
* Implemented calculus with negative numbers.
* Corrected a bug where the current number would not be reseted when the user inpute a new number after clicking '='.
* Implemented the listener for the calculator work trhough keyboard inputs
